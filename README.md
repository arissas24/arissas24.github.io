Welcome to my portfolio site for CIT 281! Below are summaries of each project I completed as part of the course.

## ðŸ’» Projects

- **Project 1: Command Line and Node.js Basics**
Introduction to using the command line, VSCode, and Node.js. I practiced creating folders, viewing directory structures, using basic CLI commands, and writing a simple JavaScript file to run with Node.js.

- **Project 2: Git and JavaScript Refactoring**
In this project, I practiced using Git through both the command line and VSCode. I refactored a JavaScript program from Project 1 to improve structure and readability, created and used a .gitignore file, and explored Git features like diff views and source control tools.

- **Project 3: Ultimate Coin Tool Web Application**
In this project, I built a Node.js application using modular programming and Express.js to create a REST API. The app calculates possible US coin combinations for a target amount and the total value of specified coins. I practiced breaking code into modules, using JSON, Git version control, and serving a web page to interact with the API.

- **Project 4: REST API for Questions and Answers**
In this project, I built a Node.js REST API to manage a data source of questions and answers. I created and tested a code module to handle data operations, then developed Express routes for GET requests. I gained experience with REST verbs, route parameters, JSON handling, and testing with Postman. For extra credit, I implemented POST routes to add new questions and answers with proper status codes.

- **Project 5: Web-Based Snake Game**
In this project, I created a web-based Snake game using JavaScript classes, code modules, and a Node.js web server. I gained hands-on experience with class constructors and methods, working with objects and arrays, and debugging server-side code in VSCode. This project combined programming fundamentals with fun by integrating AI assistance in the development process.

- **Project 6: Client-Server To-Do List Application**
For this project, I built a client-server To-Do List web application using Express.js. I enhanced my skills with HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and managed data with a server-side memory object as a simple database. I also used AI tools to assist in development and practiced version control using Git and GitHub. This project gave me practical experience creating a full client-server app tailored to my interests.
